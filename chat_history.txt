This suggests that one main architectural difference between the two models is the length of their pre-training contexts.\n\nAdditionally, it is mentioned in the text that Llama 2-Chat (with GAtt) maintains 100% accuracy up to 20 turns, whereas Llama 2-Chat without GAtt can no longer refer to attributes after only a few turns. This implies that GAtt is an architectural component unique to Llama 2-Chat, which enables it to maintain multi-turn memory and context.\n\nI don't have information on this document regarding other potential architectural differences between Llama 1 and Llama 2.",

This suggests that Llama 2 is able to understand and refer to attributes even when the context extends beyond 2048 tokens (its original training context length).\n\nAdditionally, Figure 27 shows that incorporating preference-based margin in ranking loss causes a binary split pattern in reward distribution, especially with a large margin. This indicates that Llama 2's reward model is well-calibrated with human preference and can be used as a point-wise metric.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no explicit information provided on what Llama 2 actually does or what its capabilities are beyond this context.",
